<p class="work-detail__p">
  I developed the front end for SolarCity's operation careers page. It is built on top of Drupal.
</p>
<p class="work-detail__p">
  This project was fun to develop. I enjoyed working with such a unique and modern design, high quality assets, and building a highly interactive interface.

  I was lucky enough to work a lot with Vimeo's API. With just a video's URL I was able to easily pull in videos' thumbnails, titles, and iframes with AJAX.

<p class="work-detail__p">
  The site has some interactive UI features including the <a class="work-detail__a" href="http://www.solarcity.com/careers/operations/why-solarcity" target="_blank">floating sidebar navigation</a> and the sortable and searchable <a class="work-detail__a" href="">job listing page</a>, both of which are accomplished with JavaScript.
